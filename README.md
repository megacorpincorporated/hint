## Get started

### Install Python3
Install a recent version of Python3, get it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or whatever package manager you're using.

### Checking 'pip' versions
Check which version of the Python Package Index (pip) you should use to proceed. You need to check this since many systems have Python installed by default and the command line tool "pip" usually defaults to a Python version less than 3.


```
$ which pip

# If the output displays some local path to a pre-existing version of Python located in /usr/local/... then try 'pip3' instead.

$ which pip3

# Depending on your system, this should give you the path to where the newly installed version of Python3 was installed, and in 
# which case, this is the pip command you want to use when proceeding. 'pip3' is usually more safe to use since it can only be 
# associated with Python 3.
```

### Python virtual environment setup
To separate Python packages you'll need for this project from other projects, install a Python virtual environment manager. Its documentation can be found [here](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

```
# Assuming that 'pip3' was the correct one!

$ pip3 install virtualenvwrapper
...

# This will install a wrapper for ease of use around the basic Python virtual environment manager. Now, check what Python packages 
# are installed! NOTE that the version may differ since these packages are well maintained.

$ pip3 list
Package           Version
----------------- -------
pbr               5.4.1  <--
pip               19.2.1 
setuptools        28.8.0 
six               1.12.0 <--
stevedore         1.30.1 <--
virtualenv        16.7.2 <--
virtualenv-clone  0.5.3  <--
virtualenvwrapper 4.8.4  <--
...
# The six packages above come with the installation of 'virtualenvwrapper' and are the ones we want to see here.
```

Now, in order to make the newly installed package 'virtualenvwrapper' available for use in any new terminal window you start (without having to use `export` and `source` to set environment locations each time a new shell is started), you will need to edit your shell startup file. The file to edit depends on your system, for a Mac it would be the `.bash_profile` file.
```
# Insert the following into your shell startup file

export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/Devel
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```

Sometimes, when you have multiple Python versions on your $PATH variable, virtualenvwrapper will behave weirdly. This is because it by default looks for the first version of Python it can find from the $PATH variable. If you have multiple Python versions on the $PATH variable (test by `echo $PATH` in your terminal and check manually) it can be good to also add the line `export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=<path to your Python3 version>` in order to make sure that the wrapper uses the Python version you want it to.

### Create a virtual environment
Now, after installing all the necessary Python utilities, go ahead and create a virtual environment where all Python packages related to this project can be installed.

```
# NOTE! If the below command does not work (your terminal can't find it) try opening a new shell so that you shell startup file
# gets executed and the virtualenvwrapper variable gets exported and the script sourced.

$ mkvirtualenv <name of virtual environment>
```

The command should output some installation information.

### Interacting with the virtual environment
Now that the virtual environment is created, you can exit out of it by using `deactivate`, and go back into it by using `workon <name of virtual environment>`. Make sure that you have used `workon` *before* installing any packages related to this project.

### Installing project Python dependencies
Assuming that the virtual environment related to this project is active (through `workon <name of virtual environment>`) then go ahead and install this project's dependencies.

```
# NOTE! Inside your virtual environment 'pip' will point to the Python version in use for this environment, so you do not have to
# Both 'pip' and 'pip3' should yield the same output.

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And that's it, all Python dependencies are now installed into the project's virtual Python environment and will not affect any other project on your system!

### Installing Postgres as the backend database
From installing the project requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt` you now have support for Python to interact with Postgres databases.

First, install Postgres on your system. Next, create the database which you will be developing against:

```
$ psql
psql (10.9)
Type "help" for help.

user=# CREATE DATABASE hint;
CREATE DATABASE

# Ctrl-D to exit
```

Now, create a Postgres user which Django can use to authenticate with the database.

```
# Installing Postgres should yield you the 'createuser' command in your terminal!

$ createuser --interactive --pwprompt
```
Just follow the instructions and remember both the username and password you supplied during the setup. Make sure to create a super-user!

Now, you will need to instruct Django that this new database is to be used, which will require a few steps. First, create a new Python file under `backend/settings/`, and call it `local.py`. 

`settings/` is a directory intended to keep all settings for the project, but it by default only contains the `base.py` and `__init__.py` files. `base.py` contains base settings, which you can override easily with your own, local, settings by simply re-defining fields in the separate file `local.py`. This works by the `settings/` directory actually being a Python package, you can see that by the `__init__.py` file, which indicates that the folder is to be treated as a Python package. The `__init__.py` file contains only one line: `from .local import *  # noqa`. This import ensures that all settings in `local.py` gets imported as soon as Django starts up. Django is pre-configured to, upon startup, import the `settings` Python module, which triggers the import in the `__init__.py` file. The comment `# noqa` is used to ignore the line (which is normally flagged as 'unused' by most static analysis tools/IDEs), which is useful when running linters to check your code for compliance and makes sure that those tools do not complain about this "unused" line (even though it is actually in use...).

Create the `local.py` file inside the `settings/` directory and insert the following:

```
from .base import *  # noqa

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'hint',
        'USER': '<the username you specified when creating the postgres user>',
        'PASSWORD': '<the password you specified when creating the postgres user>'
    }
}
```
The first line ensures that all settings defined in `base.py` get activated as well. `local.py` can now be used to both extend `base.py`, or to re-define settings specific to *your* development environment. The `DATABASES` dictionary contains connection information to the database that Django uses. You will need to input the username and password that you chose for the Postgres user you created above. `django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2` refers to that Django will use the `psycopg2` Python package to communicate with the Postgres database, this package is installed in your virtual environment after you installed the project's dependencies in a previous step using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. If you look in the `requirements.txt` you will see an entry stating `psycopg2=<current version of psycopg2 used>`.

### Frontend dependencies
The frontend part of this project is build with Angular. To use Angular we opted to use their Command Line Interface (Angular CLI). The Angular CLI is nice to use since it does a lot for you and is necessary to, upon code changes, immediately see the changes in the browser. It can also quickly create bare-bones Angular files for you.

To install the Angular CLI, you will first need to install both `node` and `npm`. In particular, `npm` is used as the package manager for all things Angular. By installing `node`, you'll by default also get `npm`. Install `node` by going [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) or some other way I don't know about.

### Installing the Angular CLI
Instructions taken from [here](https://angular.io/cli).

When you have `npm`, install the Angular CLI globally on your system.

```
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Now, having the Angular CLI, you should be able to use the `ng` command to access its utility functions.

### Installing project frontend dependencies
To install the project's frontend dependencies, navigate to the `frontend/` directory to place yourself in the root of the frontend part of the project. From here run `npm install` to install all dependencies, the installed packages will end up under `frontend/node_modules/` if you want to have a look. `node_modules/` will contain both dependencies stated by the `frontend/package.json` and any other dependencies of those dependencies and so on, which is why `node_modules/` tends to get extremely large.

## Running the project
In order to run the development servers needed to work on this project, both the Django development server needs to be run and the Angular code needs to be set up to be automatically compiled upon code changes.

### Running the Django development server
To start the Django development server, locate the `manage.py` file which is used to command the start of the server. `manage.py` is located at the very root of the hint project. Execute the following command while *inside* the virtual Python environment you created in the previous installation steps, this is important since your Python environment must recognize that there is a version of Django installed.

```
$ python manage.py runserver
```

Running this command should start the Django development server, maybe with a few errors complaining that there are 'unapplied migrations'. The server can be reached at localhost:8000.

### Setting up automatic re-compilation for Angular code
The automatic re-compilation command needs to be run from inside the Angular project structure (frontend/ or below that is), otherwise the command will complain that is needs to be run from inside an Angular project. Note that the directories pointed out here do depend on where you have cloned this project on your file system.

```
# --watch=true will ensure that re-compilation occurs on code change.

$ ng build --watch=true --outputPath=<ABSOLUTE PATH TO GIT PROJECT>/hint/backend/static/ang
```

It is *important* that an absolute path is pointed out and supplied as an argument to the `--outputPath` flag. If you supply a relative path (including `..` to navigate to another directory) this will not work and will crash with an extremely terrible "informative" message. Start the path with `/` to ensure it is an absolute path, and supply the entire chain of directories to the hint project and finally into `backend/static/ang`. For example `/Users/mike/my_git_projects/hint/backend/static/ang`. Note that the `ang/` directory does not exist by default, which is fine. It will be created by the above command.

That should do it!
